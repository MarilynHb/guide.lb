                        Searching for a place for a night out with friends along with cool vibes and deep house music? Then Analogue is your place.
                        Located in the vibrant district of Monot it’s a perfect place to go for drinks with a group of friends. 
                        You can sit outside on the terrace while enjoy some cocktails that stays more calm through the night or pick a table inside 
                        where the the music is playing louder and can dance later at night.
                        We went there on Friday night, it was our friend’s birthday 🎉 celebration and we were glad it was in this place. It is a nice place for a birthday indeed.
                        The vibes are awesome, the crowd is cool and the music is amazing (if you love deep house)
                        Overall the place is nice and trendy for a night out, but pretty pricey. 
                        I didn’t like that they don’t have a menu for drinks to see the prices and options🤷🏻‍♀️ they only gave us the food menu.</p>

                        Amelia is a beautiful winter lounge for dinner and drinks hidden in the busy street of Mar Mikhael. 
                        We visited the place on Sunday night and it was full! I would say even too crowded. 
                        The place looked spacious at first, as it has really high ceilings, but once it gets full, it gets uncomfortable as the tables are extremely
                        close to each other and the space is limited. <br>
                        The whole vibe of the place wasn’t as enjoyable for me. I felt as if people were looking at other people from head to toe rather than actually enjoying their time😁
                        The service was disappointing too🥲for a place like this I expected something more attentive. 
                        Waiters would take forever to notice our table, while they would be more caring with neighboring tables, maybe because they were usual customers.
                        The music 🎶 that night was nothing special also. And people weren’t dancing.<br>
                        Overall the place is very beautiful ✨and I think it is worth to visit at least once!

                        If you are looking for a great cocktail bar in Beirut, Cyrano will definitely not disappoint you with its fine cocktails.
                        You can find there some finger food to go along with your drink as well. I like to go for cheese or meat platter.<br>
                        The cocktails are really superb, if not even one of the best ones you can find in Lebanon. 
                        I like their chocolate Negroni the most, as it’s really reach in flavour.  Also they are not greedy with their alcohol 👍🏻
                        The last time we came though, we wanted to have some wine, but they barely had any white wine options, linking it to the economical situation 
                        in Lebanon (as they don’t know how much to charge you at the moment) 
                        The service is pleasant there. Better to book your table in advance.
